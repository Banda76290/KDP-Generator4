# KDP Generator Deployment Instructions

## Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the KDP Generator application using the comprehensive deployment fixes implemented on August 10, 2025.

## Prerequisites
- Replit environment with the project
- All deployment fixes applied (August 10, 2025)
- Database configured and accessible

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automated Deployment Script (Recommended)
Use the provided deployment script for automatic preparation:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This script will:
- Set required environment variables (`REPLIT_BUILD=true`)
- Run the build process with deployment-safe configuration
- Provide status updates and next steps

### Option 2: Manual Deployment Process

#### Step 1: Set Environment Variables
Before deployment, ensure these environment variables are set:

```bash
export REPLIT_BUILD=true
export NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Step 2: Build the Application
Run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Step 3: Deploy via Replit
1. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
2. Select "Autoscale Deployment"
3. Configure your deployment settings
4. Deploy the application

## Post-Deployment Configuration

### Step 1: Enable Full Functionality
After the deployment completes successfully, set the completion flag:

```bash
export REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE=true
```

### Step 2: Verify Health Status
Check the health endpoints to ensure everything is working:

- **Health Check**: `https://your-app.replit.app/health`
- **Readiness**: `https://your-app.replit.app/ready`
- **Liveness**: `https://your-app.replit.app/live`

Expected responses:
- During deployment: 503 status with deployment messages
- After completion: 200 status with operational confirmation

## Deployment Features

### Build-Safe Architecture
- All database operations are bypassed during build phase
- No external service connections attempted during deployment
- Graceful error handling prevents crashes

### Health Monitoring
- Comprehensive health check endpoints
- Real-time deployment status reporting
- Automatic service restoration post-deployment

### Database Management
- Automatic database connection deferral during deployment
- Safe storage layer with deployment mode detection
- Zero-downtime architecture with graceful degradation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors During Build**
   - **Solution**: Ensure `REPLIT_BUILD=true` is set before building
   - **Status**: Should be automatically handled by deployment fixes

2. **Service Unavailable (503) Responses**
   - **Normal During Deployment**: Expected behavior during build phase
   - **After Deployment**: Set `REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE=true`

3. **Build Failures**
   - **Check Environment**: Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - **Review Logs**: Check deployment logs for specific error messages
   - **Rollback**: Use Replit's rollback feature if necessary

### Contact Support
If deployment issues persist after following these instructions, the error message suggests contacting Replit support for platform-level assistance with:
- Database migration platform issues
- Cloud Run environment conflicts
- Underlying infrastructure problems

## Technical Details

### Environment Variables Used
- `REPLIT_BUILD`: Set to "true" during build phase
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production" for deployment
- `REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE`: Set to "true" after successful deployment
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string (should be available post-deployment)

### Files Modified for Deployment Safety
- `server/db.ts`: Enhanced database initialization with build detection
- `server/storage.ts`: Safe database operations with deployment mode handling
- `server/utils/deploymentHelper.ts`: Comprehensive deployment mode detection
- `server/middleware/errorHandler.ts`: Deployment-aware error handling
- `server/buildSafeIndex.ts`: Alternative build-safe server entry point
- `deploy.sh`: Automated deployment preparation script

## Success Criteria

✅ Build completes without database connection errors
✅ Health endpoints respond appropriately during deployment
✅ Application starts successfully after deployment
✅ Database operations resume after setting completion flag
✅ Full functionality restored post-deployment
